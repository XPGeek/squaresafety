# squaresafety
Square Safety leverages multiple AI instances to monitor each other, creating N² monitoring relationships while maintaining O(N) computational cost. This quadratic growth in oversight connections provides disproportionately robust defense against AI collusion and deception, enabling safer autonomous AI scaling without human oversight bottlenecks.
